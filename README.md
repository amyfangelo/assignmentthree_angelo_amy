# Assignment 3
>“I have read the Code Requirements
Reference Sheet. My code follows the requirements”
`I started over from scratch on this assignment based on what we did last week. I rewatched the lecture from last week and I also watched the sass lecture twice. I transferred my CSS to Sass and learned how to add, commit and push my edits onto Github. I added a file structure through the terminal and cleaned up my code.`
